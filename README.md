## React: Lights-Out Minigame

Small project created using React and JSX emulating the lights-out minigame, in which a specified number of columns and cells are generated (default: 5, 5). Given a percentage, some lights start toggled "on" or "off". 

The user must turn off all the lights, but each light will "flip" its adjacent lights. 

If a light is on, as well as the upper, left, right, and lower lights, clicking on the former light will turn **all** of them off.
